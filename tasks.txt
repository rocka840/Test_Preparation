You are given two arrays:

$items = ["Fruits", "Vegetables", "Meat", "Carrots", "Peas", "Tomatoes"];
$indices = [1,0,3,4,5,6,2,0];

TASK 1: Check if the INDICES in the second array ARE VALID indices to use in the FIRST array. If you have any item OUT of range, you should display and error.

TASK 2: Assuming the correct indices array, display an unordered list with items from the $items array using the given $indices array.
